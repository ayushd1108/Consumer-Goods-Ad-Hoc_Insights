# Consumer-Goods-Ad-Hoc_Insights

## Company: Atliq Hardwares

**Atliq Hardwares** is a leading computer hardware producer based in India with a growing presence in global markets. The company aims to utilize data analytics to improve decision-making processes and strengthen its competitive edge.

## Challenge Overview

Atliq Hardwares recognized the need for deeper insights to make smarter, faster decisions. The company is expanding its data analytics team and wanted to assess junior data analysts on their ability to handle both technical and communication skills.

To meet this need, Tony Sharma, the Director of Data Analytics, devised a SQL challenge to evaluate applicants' proficiency. The challenge involved providing actionable insights from a dataset based on 10 specific ad-hoc business requests.

## My Task

As an applicant for this role, my responsibilities included:

- Reviewing the [ad-hoc-requests.pdf](https://github.com/ayushd1108/Consumer-Goods-Ad-Hoc_Insights/blob/main/ad-hoc-requests.pdf), which outlines 10 key business insights required for the company.
- Writing and executing [SQL queries](https://github.com/ayushd1108/Consumer-Goods-Ad-Hoc_Insights/blob/main/SQL_code.sql) to retrieve the necessary data to answer these requests.
- Designing a comprehensive [presentation](https://github.com/ayushd1108/Consumer-Goods-Ad-Hoc_Insights/blob/main/Ad-Hoc-Analysis%20Presentation.pptx) ([Presentation PDF](https://github.com/ayushd1108/Consumer-Goods-Ad-Hoc_Insights/blob/main/Ad-Hoc%20Analysis%20PDF.pdf))to communicate the insights to top-level management, ensuring clarity and actionable recommendations.
- I additinally created a [Power BI report](https://github.com/ayushd1108/Consumer-Goods-Ad-Hoc_Insights/blob/main/Consumer%20Goods%20Ad-Hoc-Analysis%20Visualization.pbix) to visualize the data for stakeholders.

## My Approach

**Data Extraction with SQL**
- I utilized **MySQL** to write SQL queries that would extract the required data from the provided dataset.
- Each SQL query was carefully crafted to answer a specific business request from the ad-hoc report.

**Data Visualization**
- The results from the SQL queries were then visualized using **Power BI** to create meaningful and clear visualizations.
- These visualizations helped highlight trends, patterns, and actionable insights that would be valuable for executive-level decision-making.

**Presentation Design**
- I developed a **Microsoft PowerPoint** presentation to communicate the insights effectively to top-level management.
- The presentation was designed to be both professional and visually engaging, with a focus on clarity and actionable takeaways.

**Actionable Insights**
- Each insight was accompanied by strategic recommendations, providing Atliq Hardwares’ management with data-driven decisions they could act upon immediately.

## Outcome

This project allowed me to demonstrate a combination of technical skills in SQL querying, analytical thinking, data visualization, and the ability to communicate complex insights in a professional manner. I believe this showcases my capacity to contribute to Atliq Hardwares' goal of leveraging data for smarter decision-making.
